        I strongly believe in removing boundaries. 
        In fact, I built my personal & professional life on trust, 
        collaboration and authentic relationships. 
        A successful career in media and multinational 
        companies made me realize I could have a positive 
        impact on young generations and society bridging education, communication and technology. 
        This is why with an energetic and insightful Team of entrepreneurs I cofounded Epicode, and… we’re 
        building a lifelong career accelerator platform.
